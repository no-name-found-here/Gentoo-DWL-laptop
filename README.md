# Gentoo + DWL = <3
I finally took the time to create this page which describes my 2 biggest loves (besides my girlfriend and my cat): Gentoo and DWL.  I'm fully aware my other repositories are about Archlinux which isn't a bad distribution at all, but I have been using Gentoo exclusively on my dekstop since 2004 and experimented with it when it was still called Enoch.
Because my laptop is used a lot less than my desktop I never bothered with installing Gentoo on it at first.

I decided to go for a rice with a Gentoo feeling to it.

## More to come ... I promise :)
